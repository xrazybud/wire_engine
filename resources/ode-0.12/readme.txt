This resource is created to use Open Dynamics Engine, this project is aimed to be used in Raspberry Pi (Desktop compatibility is also a concern, but not priority), to avoid recompiling ODE in other system (it's slow) ODE is included in binary mode only for Rasberry Pi Debian. 

A free, industrial quality library for simulating articulated rigid body dynamics - for example ground vehicles, legged creatures, and moving objects in VR environments. It's fast, flexible & robust. Built-in collision detection.
